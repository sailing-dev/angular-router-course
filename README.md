# Installation Instructions

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/angular-university/angular-router-course.git
        

NOTE: you need npm 5 or higher in order for the package-lock.json to be taken into account:

    npm install 

By using npm 5 or higher and the package-lock.json file, you will be installing the exact same dependencies than I installed in my machine, so you wont run into issues caused by semantic versioning updates.

This should take a couple of minutes. If there are issues, please post the complete error message in the Questions section of the course.

# To Run the Development Server

    npm start

  The application is visible at port 8080 - [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
